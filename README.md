# Store-Sales-Prediction

## Project Overview: 
This project aims to predict the sales of different stores using machine learning techniques in Python. By analyzing factors like customer count, day of week, promotions, and holidays, we hope to gain insights into what drives store sales and build a model that can accurately predict future performance.

## Goals:
* Implement various machine learning models, including linear regression and boosting algorithms, to predict store sales.
* Compare the performance of different models and identify the one that offers the best results for our specific dataset.
* Utilize data exploration and visualization techniques to understand the relationships between various factors and sales.
* Gain valuable insights into the drivers of store sales within the given dataset.
