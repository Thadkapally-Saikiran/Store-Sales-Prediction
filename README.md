# Store-Sales-Prediction using Machine Learning in Python

![](intro_image.jpg)
---

## Project Overview: 
This project aims to predict sales for various stores using machine learning and Python. We'll leverage historical sales data and store attributes to identify factors influencing future sales performance. Predictive analytics will be employed to uncover these relationships and build effective models.

## Goals:
* Implement various machine learning models, including linear regression and boosting algorithms, to predict store sales.
* Compare the performance of different models and identify the one that offers the best results for our specific dataset.
* Utilize data exploration and visualization techniques to understand the relationships between various factors and sales.
* Gain valuable insights into the drivers of store sales within the given dataset.

## Methodology:
* Data Preprocessing: Explore and clean the provided datasets ("train_v2.csv", "test_v2.csv", "store.csv"). This includes handling missing values, outliers, and potentially removing irrelevant data points like closed stores with no sales.
* Data Analysis: Utilize visualization techniques to identify potential correlations between features like customer count, day of week, promotions, and holidays with store sales.
* Model Building: Implement and train various machine learning models, including linear regression, XGBoost, and other boosting algorithms, to predict future sales based on available features.
* Model Evaluation: Compare the performance of different models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared to identify the most effective one for our dataset.
* Visualization and Reporting: Present the findings through visualizations and reports, highlighting key insights about the drivers of store sales and the performance of different models.

## Project Files:
